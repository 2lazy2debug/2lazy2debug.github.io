This isn't a portfolio site,
if you're a headhunter you might directly head to my <a href="https://ch.linkedin.com/in/manuel-cabras-8770756b">LinkedIn Profile</a>.
But if you're looking for some lulz, for some brainfarts or some funny stories, bro, 
THIS IS DA PLACE. 
</p><p>Let's introduce myself briefly, shall we? My name is Manuel, I live in a small town in 
Switzerland, am 24 and I'm a software developer. And this is where shit hits the fun. 
I'm a lazy dev, but not the kind of lazy you'd think, I'm REALLY lazy. Don't even bother
asking me if I wrote tests, I probably didn't. CI? Why should I setup that? Too much work. 
</p><p>So just to be clear, the site is still work in progress. Cheers <3.</p></div><div class="footer"><p>Copyright Â© 2019 2lazy2debug (Manuel Cabras)</p><p>Made with <3 with <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>, powered by <a href="https://nodejs.org">NodeJS</a>.</p></div></body></html>
